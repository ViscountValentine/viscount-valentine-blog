      <h3>Glitch</h3>
      <p><span class="bold">Glitch Art</span> is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices.</p>
      <p>As a technical word, a glitch is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts.</p>

      <p>This piece exemplifies this new design philosophy and the harmonious juxtaposition of the languages and cultures it is based upon.</p>

      <p>Echoes of faraway places and Oriental elements are glimpsed in the “disorienting” design of this storage unit, which seems to have been “deformed” by a strong jolt or by swaying movements. Although it appears to depart from the aesthetics of
        the past, in fact it draws upon ancient knowledge in the use of carving and fine wood workmanship.</p>

      <p>The appeal of this extraordinary piece of furniture lies in its ability to overturn and question classical stylistic principles such as purity, cleanness and symmetry, while evoking a comforting feeling of deja-vù and a sort of
        primitiveness, matched by unquestionable craftsmanship.</p>

      <p>This piece of oak furniture would be created by CNC processes (computer-aided machine tools) in order to make it appear as if it had been deformed by a digital glitch.</p>

      <h4>Sebastian Brajkovic</h4>
      <p>The Dutch-Croatian-Indonesian designer was born in 1975. Sebastian Brajkovic holds a keen interest in the divide between art and design, and exploring the border between the two has long fueled his practice. He graduated from the Design
        Academy Eindhoven in 2006 and burst onto the art-world scene with his project Lathe. He investigates the notion of perspective and distortion of form through his sculptural furniture pieces.</p>

      <p>The Lathe series, expanded for his first solo show at the Carpenters Workshop Gallery in 2008, reflects his longstanding fascination with rotation. The Lathe tables at once illustrate and innovate the idea of turned furniture. The spinning
        motion of a lathe both creates the table and decorates it. The rotation is visible in the table’s exaggerated profile and in the layers of concentric whorls on its surface. Through his in-depth exploration of the theoretical and the
        technical, Brajkovic creates an aesthetic balance of structure, freedom, and form. The Lathe chairs also employ woodcarving, bronze casting, and embroidery. Each work is sculpted by hand before being molded. At the same time, Brajkovic
        employs new digital techniques for sculpture, harnessing the power to expand pixels and distort images.</p>

      <p>There is a disparity between the delicate look and substantial feel of his works. Often composed of bronze, they are too heavy to be lifted without mechanical assistance. As such, their archetypal function is subverted by their substance.

      <h3>Glitch Rugs</h3>
      <h4>Faig Ahmed</h4>
      <p>Faig Ahmed is an internationally recognised artist from Baku, Azerbaijan, who represented Azerbaijan at there Veinice BIenniale in 2007. He is well known for his conceptual works that utilise traditional decorative craft and the visual
        language of carpets into contemporary sculptural works of art. His works reimagine ancient crafts and create new visual boundaries by deconstructing traditions and stereotypes.</p>

      <p>Ahmed's artworks engage the viewers through it's unexpected marriage of traditional crafts steeped in history, with hyper-contemporary, digitally distorted images often in the form of pixelation, three-dimensional shapes and melting paint
        that alters the pattern on the rugs. He employs computers to sketch his works and chooses intricate traditional methods of carpet-weaving techniques to printing his designs on carpets.</p>

      <h3>Glitch Art</h3>
      <p>Glitch Art is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices.</p>
      <h4>Heitor Magno</h4>
      <p>Heitor Magno is an experimental artist and photographer who leans towards double exposure art as his main forte. Most of his work revolves around replacing models faces with painted glitches, fire or photographs of flowers. The double
        exposures in his photographs allow the brightest sections of the model to become transparent, giving the artist the opportunity to mix two or three different photographs together. When he uses this technique for glitching photographs, he
        usually covers the faces of the subjects. He also tends to digitally enhance photographs, moving sections and creating a broken/corrupt look. A lot of his artwork is very pale and washed out which makes the glitch stand out a lot more with
        vivid colours and abstract shapes.</p>

      <h3>Glitch In Interior Design</h3>
      <p>I found these wonderful abstract expressionistic murals and thought I'd include them in the concept of glitch interior design. There are paper backed murals that are giant photographs similar to the images here under the headings of glitch.
        I just felt it was important to see this concept creativity through my own design eyes.</p>
      <h4>Camille Javal</h4>
      <p>CAMILLE JAVAL (FKA HAYTON :) IS A MULTIDISCIPLINARY ARTIST, DESIGNER AND CAMILLEON ORIGINALLY FROM AUSTRALIA. SHE IS MOST KNOWN FOR CREATING ABSTRACT PAINTINGS YOU CAN STEP INTO AND FINE ART MURALS IN RESIDENTIAL AND PUBLIC SPACES.” ♡</p>
      <p>CJ approaches every creative project and collaboration with the eye and sensitivity of a fine artist. Her artwork has been described as an intersection between Art ☆ Fashion ☆ Installation ☆ Interiors, which = her design sweet spot.</p>
      <p>“My passion for storytelling and connection has been channeled through many different mediums over the years. At the core I’m interested in creating visual content and theatrical worlds that genuinely move people, utilizing technology while
        maintaining connection with the creator. More recently I’m seeking to shift the atmosphere of urban interior spaces through an intuitive application of color / mark making and navigating creative flow.”</p>
      <p>Initially working with the medium of digital collage and paper, Camille’s artwork evolved onto walls and wall sized canvases as she became more curious about the idea of space - how we use it, how it makes us feel. The artist transforms the
        places she paints by creating immersive artworks that are entered rather than simply observed. Alongside her passion for place, she explores functionally how color, light and mark making can stimulate well-being, productivity, imagination and
        community engagement.</p>
      <p>Through slowly finding her own (creative) voice, Camille is excited to help other women also find theirs. After personally experiencing healing through her artistic practice, she champions healing through the arts and addressing community
        and social needs with creative means.</p>

      <h3>Datamoshing</h3>
      <p>This overlapping of two different moving images in order to bleed into eachother is called datamoshing. This always looks very glitchy, lo-res, pixelated, artsy and psychedelic. There's nothing wrong with your computer screen, its only
        datamoshing.</p>
      <p>Datamoshing started as a video artform in the early 00's by artists like Sven Konig, Takeshi Murata, Jacques Percent, Paper Rad, and David O'Reilly. It's also widely used for music videos, with Chairlift's 'Evident Utensil' being the most
        famous one.</p>

      <h3>Synthwave</h3>
      <p>Synthwave is an electronic music microgenre that is is based predominately on the music associated with action, science-fiction, and horror film soundtracks of the 1980s. Other influences are drawn from that decade's art and video games.
        Synthwave musicians often espouse nostalgia for 1980s culture and attempt to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it.</p>
      <p>Visually it represents retro 1980's aesthetics such as VHS tracking arifacts, magenta neon, and gridlines. The term comes from the 1986 driving arcade game Out Run.</p>
      <h4>TRON 1982</h4>
      <p>Tron (stylised as TRON) is a 1982 American science fiction action-adventure film about a computer programmer who is transported inside the software world of a mainframe computer where he interacts with programs in his attempt to escape.</p>

      <h3>Pablo Ladosa</h3>
      <p>Urban Illustrations</p>
      <p>City Nights is a collection of illustrations made for PokerStars that will be around the website and games. I wanted to do super detailed illustrations of a modern city, alive, with vibrant colours. Inspired in my photos I take in the iPhone
        walking back home afterwork around London, below some I try to capture the lights and soft colours in the sky, but vibrant and glowing lights.
