          <h3>Glitch</h3>
              <p><span class="bold">Glitch Art</span> is the practice of using digital or analog errors for aesthetic purposes by either corrupting digital data or physically manipulating electronic devices.</p>
              <p>As a technical word, a glitch is the unexpected result of a malfunction, especially occurring in software, video games, images, videos, audio, and other digital artefacts.</p>

              <p>This piece exemplifies this new design philosophy and the harmonious juxtaposition of the languages and cultures it is based upon.</p>

              <p>Echoes of faraway places and Oriental elements are glimpsed in the “disorienting” design of this storage unit, which seems to have been “deformed” by a strong jolt or by swaying movements. Although it appears to depart from the aesthetics of the past, in fact it draws upon ancient knowledge in the use of carving and fine wood workmanship.</p>

              <p>The appeal of this extraordinary piece of furniture lies in its ability to overturn and question classical stylistic principles such as purity, cleanness and symmetry, while evoking a comforting feeling of deja-vù and a sort of primitiveness, matched by unquestionable craftsmanship.</p>

              <p>This piece of oak furniture would be created by CNC processes (computer-aided machine tools) in order to make it appear as if it had been deformed by a digital glitch.</p>

            <h4>Sebastian Brajkovic</h4>
              <p>The Dutch-Croatian-Indonesian designer was born in 1975. Sebastian Brajkovic holds a keen interest in the divide between art and design, and exploring the border between the two has long fueled his practice. He graduated from the Design Academy Eindhoven in 2006 and burst onto the art-world scene with his project Lathe. He investigates the notion of perspective and distortion of form through his sculptural furniture pieces.</p>

              <p>The Lathe series, expanded for his first solo show at the Carpenters Workshop Gallery in 2008, reflects his longstanding fascination with rotation. The Lathe tables at once illustrate and innovate the idea of turned furniture. The spinning motion of a lathe both creates the table and decorates it. The rotation is visible in the table’s exaggerated profile and in the layers of concentric whorls on its surface. Through his in-depth exploration of the theoretical and the technical, Brajkovic creates an aesthetic balance of structure, freedom, and form. The Lathe chairs also employ woodcarving, bronze casting, and embroidery. Each work is sculpted by hand before being molded. At the same time, Brajkovic employs new digital techniques for sculpture, harnessing the power to expand pixels and distort images.</p>

              <p>There is a disparity between the delicate look and substantial feel of his works. Often composed of bronze, they are too heavy to be lifted without mechanical assistance. As such, their archetypal function is subverted by their substance.</p>

          <h3>Glitch Rugs</h3>
            <h4>Faig Ahmed</h4>
              <p>Faig Ahmed is an internationally recognised artist from Baku, Azerbaijan, who represented Azerbaijan at there Veinice BIenniale in 2007. He is well known for his conceptual works that utilise traditional decorative craft and the visual language of carpets into contemporary sculptural works of art. His works reimagine ancient crafts and create new visual boundaries by deconstructing traditions and stereotypes.</p>

              <p>Ahmed's artworks engage the viewers through it's unexpected marriage of traditional crafts steeped in history, with hyper-contemporary, digitally distorted images often in the form of pixelation, three-dimensional shapes and melting paint that alters the pattern on the rugs. He employs computers to sketch his works and chooses intricate traditional methods of carpet-weaving techniques to printing his designs on carpets.</p>
